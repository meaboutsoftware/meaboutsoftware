### Hi everyone, I am MJ! 👋

Problem solver. Software architect. Consultant.

Love to learn from others and love to share knowledge. Moves forward – both himself and projects.

We live in a world full of changes and have to continuously learn. Things that are modern today will cease to be so in a week, a month, or a year. I would like to share as much timeless knowledge as possible. I hope you will not be disappointed.

Feel free to contact me through my email or any social media!☎️
